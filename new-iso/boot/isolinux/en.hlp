Tip: press [Esc] at any time to leave the help system.helpUsing the Help System The help system consists of a set of linked pages that you can navigate through with the follow keys. 
  • [Up Arrow] -- highlight previous link  • [Down Arrow] -- highlight next link  • [Left Arrow], [Backspace] -- return to previous page  • [Right Arrow], [Enter, [Space] -- follow link  • [Page Up], [Home] -- go to first link on page  • [Page Down], [End] -- go to last link on page  • [Esc] -- leave help
Tip: use [Left Arrow] or [Backspace] to go back to your place (same highlighted link) on the previous page.
Go to general-helpGeneral Help
Return to the mainMain Menugeneral-helpGeneral HelpThis bootloader lets you select what to boot: antiX Linux, hard drive boot, or memtest. In the case of antiX Linux you can select which boot parameters (cheat codes) get set. There are three ways to enter information:
  • Main Menu
 [Up Arrow] and [Down Arrow] select which program to run and some boot options. [Enter] starts the boot process.
  • Boot Options
 [Left Arrow], [Right Arrow], and [Backspace] edit some main menu options directly. You can also type in new options.
  • Function Key Pop-up Menus
 [F2] through [F8] open menus. Navigate them with the arrow keys. [Enter] selects highlighted option. [Esc] leaves the pop-up menu without selecting an entry.
Tip: press [F12] to see all the currently selected boot options.
Go to helpUsing the Help System
 Return to the mainMain MenulanguageF2: Select LanguagePress [F2] to get a list of supported languages. Select your language. In addition to setting the language, this option will also set the keyboard layout and timezone. If your country has more than one timezone then use the F3 Timezone menu to explicitly set the timezone for your area.
This menu is an easy shortcut for entering lang=[language-code] directly on the boot options line.
The default language is American English.
Return to the mainMain MenutimezoneF3: Select TimezonePress [F3] to get at list of cities in various time zones. The cities are listed in time zone order so they circle the globe eastward. If your area uses Daylight Savings Time then make sure you select a city that does also. These cities are marked with a trailing * (asterisk). Your system will be started using the timezone selected.
 The menu is an easy shortcut for entering tz=[your-timezone] directly on the boot line. 
The default time zone is Eastern Time (EST or EDT depending on the time of year).
Tip: you do not have to use this menu if you have set a language and your country/area has only one time-zone.
Return to the mainMain MenuoptionsF4: Miscellaneous Options  • checkmd5
 check integrity of the install media.  • checkfs
 check integrity of the LivUSB and persistent file systems (if any).  • toram
 copy the compressed file system to RAM. This takes extra time when you boot but results in a very fast system (if you have enough RAM).  • nousb2
 Disable all usb-2 devices. This helps a few older systems boot LiveUSB.
See mountingMounting Options for the rest of the F4 menu option.
 Return to the mainMain MenumountingF4: Mounting OptionsThe Live system will dynamically update the fstab file whenever a usb drive gets plugged in. You can also choose to have drives mounted automatically when they are plugged in.
  • automount -- mount drives when they are plugged in  • mount=usb -- in addition, mount all usb drives at boot time  • mount=all -- in addition, mount non-usb drives at boot time
Note: Your automount choices are saved on persistent systems.
See optionsMisc. Options for the rest of the F4 menu options.
Return to mainMain MenupersistF5: Persistence Options  • Frugal
 Copy files from the install media (LiveCD/USB) to an internal hard drive partition and finish booting from that. Think of this as a to-disk analogy of toram boot parameter.
  • Root Persist
 Save all the changes to the file-system in RAM and then transfer these changes to disk right before you shutdown or reboot. Fast, but space is limited by how much RAM you have.
  • Static Root
 Saves all your file-system changes directly to a file. This can be slow but it requires no extra RAM and no changes need to be transfered when you shutdown.
  • Home Persist
 Only save changes to files and directories under /home. This will include all of your bookmarks and personal settings. Changes are stored immediately and speed is almost never an issue.
Return to the mainMain MenudesktopF6: Select Desktop ProgramOn full and base systems, there are a number of desktop programs (window managers) available. The F6 menu allows you to choose which desktop program to use. This menu also shows you which desktop programs are installed on the standard antiX iso (either full or base).
Desktop codes that start with Rox- (Rox pinboard) or Space- (SpaceFM desktop) come with desktop icons. These are often convenient for people who are just starting out. The min- prefix goes in the opposite direction and boots the selected window manager with the least amount of additional bells and whistles.
If you are running a persistent system and you install new window manager programs then you can boot into them by typing desktop=program-name. Look in the /usr/share/xsessions/ directory to see what names should be used.
New for antiX-15: there are now two theme related options in the F6 menu called Dark theme and Light theme. Since dark is the default use Light theme to change the color scheme of all the desktop programs (Fluxbox, IceWM, etc).
Return to the mainMain MenuconsoleF7: Set Console ResolutionThis menu allows you to set the resolution of the virtual consoles using the deprecated vga kernel boot parameter. This works well on many older systems but on newer systems with wide screen displays the codes used are non-standard. For example the 1600x1200* resolution works in Virtual Box but may not work elsewhere.
Most newer systems support Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) which lets the video driver handle the consoles and automatically sets the highest resolution possible.
  • vga=788 800×600  • vga=791 1024×768  • vga=794 1280×1024  • vga=895 1366x768  • vga=980 1600×900  • vga=798 1600×1200  • vga=839 1600×1200*  • vga=ask ask
Return to the mainMain MenufrugalFrugal InstallReturn to the mainMain MenusaveF8: Save Bootloader SettingsOn LiveUSBs and Frugal installs, the F8 Save menu should appear. A LiveUSB made with the "dd" command acts like a LiveCD and does not have the F8 Save menu.
  • save
 Save the current function key popup menu settings as the defaults and create/replace a custom main menu entry if needed for options that are typed if they don't exist in the popup menus.
  • reset
 Restore the original menu defaults. Does not affect the custom main menu entry (if one was created).
Return to the mainMain Menumain_menuMain Menu EntriesantiX-VERSION (DATE)
 Boot the system normally. You can use the Function key menus to select various options such as consoleConsole resolution, various optionsOptions, or persistPersistence. 

Safe Video Mode
 Disable KMS (kernel mode set) video drivers and force the use of the vesa video driver. Try this option of the system seems to boot but the screen is blank. 

Failsafe Boot
 In addition to forcing safe video, also load all drivers early in the boot process. Try this option if the system does not boot at all. 

Boot from Hard Drive
 This will try to do a legacy (BIOS) from the first internal hard drive. Windows 8 and above use UEFI instead of BIOS so this entry won't be able to boot them. 

Test Memory
 Test the system memory without booting into any operating system. 
Return to the mainMain Menumain_optionsMain Menu Boot Options These are the options that show up in the Boot Options box. 
quiet Tell the kernel to not print a lot of debugging information to the screen.
splash=v Enable background decoration on the virtual (text) consoles. Delete it or set it to off to disable these decorations.
bo_antixdisable_srv=LX Disable some startup services for faster booting and less RAM usage.
nomodeset Do not let the video driver take over the console. If the screen goes blank early in the boot process then you probably need this option.
xorg=safe Disable the hardware video driver from controlling graphics mode. Some drivers have trouble with older hardware.
failsafe Load all drivers early in the boot process and enable safe video mode. Use this if the live media fails to boot. To only load all drivers use load=all.
Return to the mainMain Menubo_instructBoot Option InstructionsThere are many boot options available. They are usually only necessary if your system will not boot properly. To use the boot options just place the appropriate code in the Boot Options box at the bottom of the main screen. You may also need to edit or delete options that are already in the Boot Options box.
You can't make permanent changes on a LiveCD or a LiveDVD. You have to enter them each time you boot. You can make permanent changes on some LiveUSBs.
Go to bo_antixantiX Boot Options
 Go to mm_bootKernel Boot Options
Return to mainMain Menubo_antixantiX Boot OptionsThese are options that are only available in antiX
  • lean -- disable some services including wicd for a fast boot  • mean -- disable dhclient (Internet connection)  • Xtralean -- disable more services for a faster boot  • nodbus -- disable dbus service  • dpi=XX -- set dpi. Default is 96
NOTE: Four of these options are combined into the single disable_srv= option. For example disable_srv=LMX.
  • L stands for lean  • M stands for mean  • X stands for Xtralean  • D stands for nodbus

  • bo_acpiACPI -- Advanced Configuration and Power Interface  • bo_ideIDE DMA -- enable/disable DMA for IDE-Drives  • bo_nonoXXXX -- skip detection of specific hardware  • bo_pciPCI -- options for non-working PS2 mice and bad PCI controllers
Back to bo_instructBoot Option Instructions
 Return to the mainMain Menubo_acpiACPIACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when boot detects a BIOS newer than the year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI:
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=off -- turn off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- turn on ACPI, for pre-2000 BIOS
Return to mm_bootBoot Options | mainMain Menubo_nonoXXXX Skips detection of or enables support for specific hardware. 
  • noauto -- turn off hardware autodetection  • noparallel -- turn off parallel printer support  • nopcmcia -- turn off PCMCIA support  • nousb -- turn off usb device probing  • nousebios -- enable NoUseBios mode needed for some Savage cards  • smouse -- enable only a serial mouse  • swcursor -- enable sw_cursor mode needed for some ATI and Trident cards
